# Notion ticker

## What it does?
It plays audio when ever you check 'to-do' section in notion as complete and prints supportive text when you do it.

## How to install it
1. Install the repo
2. Make audio avaliable on localhost. I use blank `index.html` and Live server extension in vscode to achieve it.
